    "content": [
      "My journey began in Electronics and Communication Engineering, but I was quickly drawn into Computer Science through the sheer joy of problem-solving. What started with frontend development soon expanded into backend systems, databases, system design, and eventually cloud computing. Each step revealed new layers of complexity and possibility.",
      "Here's what drives me: I'm incredibly self-driven and constantly comparing systems, approaches, and solutions. I'm usually overloaded with questions like <em>'Why is this particular thing built this way?'</em> Turns out, that relentless curiosity is exactly the instinct you need for system design, so I guess I'm doing exactly what I was meant to do.",
      "But I'm never done learning. Right now, I have my foot deep in AI, constantly exploring new technologies because learning different tech stacks gives me more tools to solve real-world problems. Every new framework, every new approach, every new paradigm expands what's possible. When I'm not coding, you'll find me traveling and drawing portraits, which, funny enough, connects right back to why I love frontend development. Both require the same eye for composition, balance, and making something beautiful that people want to look at.",
      "Whether it's architecting a complex distributed system or crafting an intuitive user interface, I believe the best solutions emerge when technical excellence meets genuine curiosity about what's possible.",
